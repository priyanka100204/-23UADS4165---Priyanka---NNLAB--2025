Objective - To build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras.

1.Classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

2.Analyze the effect of key hyperparameters: Filter Size, Regularization, Batch Size, Optimization Algorithm

3.Dataset
Fashion MNIST: 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items (28x28 pixels).
               60,000 training images.
               10,000 test images.
               10 classes such as T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, etc.

4.CNN Architecture :
Conv2D Layer: Extract features from image using different filter sizes.

MaxPooling2D: Downsamples the feature maps.

Flatten: Converts 2D features into 1D.

Dense Layer: Fully connected layer for classification.

Dropout: Prevents overfitting.

Output Layer: 10 neurons with Softmax activation.

5.Evaluation Metrics:

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy,

Accuracy: Main evaluation metric,

Validation Accuracy: Used to monitor model generalization,

Test Accuracy: Final evaluation.

6.Conclusion :
CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks like Fashion MNIST.

Tuning filter size, regularization, batch size, and optimizer significantly impacts model performance.

Best performance in this experiment was observed using:

Filter size 3x3,

Adam Optimizer,

Batch size 64,

With/without L2 depending on overfitting.
